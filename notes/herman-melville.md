Astronomy fascinated Herman Melville and provided an important and recurring theme in all his writing. He was inspired by uranography, stellar lore, ancient philosophical notions about the nature of the universe, and discoveries and speculations in contemporary astronomy. In Herman Melville: Stargazer Brett Zimmerman investigates Melville's knowledge and literary uses of astronomy, especially within the thematic contexts of Mardi, Clarel, and Billy Budd.  --- [Herman Melville | McGill-Queen’s University Press](http://www.mqup.ca/herman-melville-products-9780773517868.php)

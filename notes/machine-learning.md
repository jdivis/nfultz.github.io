Machine learning offers a fantastically powerful toolkit for building useful complex

prediction systems quickly. This paper argues it is dangerous to think of

these quick wins as coming for free. Using the software engineering framework

of technical debt, we find it is common to incur massive ongoing maintenance

costs in real-world ML systems. We explore several ML-specific risk factors to

account for in system design. These include boundary erosion, entanglement,

hidden feedback loops, undeclared consumers, data dependencies, configuration

issues, changes in the external world, and a variety of system-level anti-patterns.[ML is tech debt](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5656-hidden-technical-debt-in-machine-learning-systems.pdf)

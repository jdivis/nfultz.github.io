<article><p>Want to artificially decrease the lifespan of your product in order to keep your revenue stream intact? DRM's got your back, yo. It never asks, &quot;Why?&quot; It only asks, &quot;Why not?&quot;</p>
<p>Run out of refills on Proprietary Cat Waste Cleaning Product™ and a $200 luxury litter box becomes indiscernible from its $10 counterpart. Like generating a tremendous amount of waste along with your single cup of coffee? Hey, great, but your k-cup refill better be on brand or your expensive coffee maker will be about as active as the one you picked up from a garage sale for $2. Or less so, considering the second-hand one at least generated a funky burning smell before shorting out the kitchen wiring.</p>
<p>But this one tops both of those in what the installed DRM does to artificially shorten the lifespan of the product. (h/t Techdirt reader Kaden)</p>
<p>The IlluMask is a $30 &quot;light therapy&quot; mask that utilizes LED lights to zap away bacteria, stimulate skin cells and otherwise fight acne/aging (depending on what model you purchase.) Sounds great (if you buy IlluMask's claims). A lifetime of skin revitalization, and all for just $30. Oh, wait.</p>
<p>The trouble is, it is limited to 30 daily uses of 15 minutes each, totaling just 7 1/2 hours, effectively lasting you a month. At the end of which, you just discard the device and get a new one. That seems like a ridiculous waste of a perfectly fine, functional device whose LED’s can last at least 30,000 to 40,000 hours. --- <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150317/08091030343/drm-how-to-make-30000-hour-led-bulbs.shtml">DRM; Or How To Make 30,000-Hour LED Bulbs 'Last' Only One Month | Techdirt</a></p>

Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche was a German philosopher, cultural critic, poet, composer, and Latin and Greek scholar. 

He wrote several critical texts on religion, morality, contemporary culture, philosophy, and science, displaying a fondness for [[Metaphor and Irony]] - [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche)

Nietzsche's key ideas include perspectivism, the will to power, master-slave morality, the death of God, the Ãœbermensch and eternal recurrence. One of the key tenets of his philosophy is "life-affirmation", which embraces the realities of the world in which we live over the idea of a world beyond. It further champions the creative powers of the individual to strive beyond social, cultural, and moral contexts.

The creator is legislator-dancer.

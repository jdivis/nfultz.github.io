Why the FBI Shouldn’t Arrest Me



Although researchers typically only release passwords, I am releasing usernames with the passwords. Analysis of usernames with passwords is an area that has been greatly neglected and can provide as much insight as studying passwords alone. Most researchers are afraid to publish usernames and passwords together because combined they become an authentication feature. If simply linking to already released authentication features in a private IRC channel was considered trafficking, surely the FBI would consider releasing the actual data to the public a crime. --- [Today I Am Releasing Ten Million Passwords](https://xato.net/passwords/ten-million-passwords/#.VNlpTjWVv0o)

Kingpins used to be suave and sophisticated with designer clothes and bikini-clad women: summer blockbuster material, rap music material. Drug barons vaunted the fruit of their felonious labor. But Ross's life as a digital drug lord was far from glamorous. He ate salmon, bread made of sprouted wheat, lean cuts of beef, asparagus. His clothes were from Old Navy, Target, American Eagle. He wasn't a drug addict, and he didn't hang out with any. One-night stands, as far as I could tell, were not his cup of tea.

Better yet, did you know you can program a botnet on your old laptop to generate $30 a day in fake Spotify listens?



These gratuities may seem harmless or even deserved, but they foreshadow a major vulnerability in the current model of online music streaming. Just as publishers learned about click farming, streaming music services are learning about listen farming. And if automated listening continues unchallenged, music streaming may cease to provide any meaningful income for legitimate (even popular) musicians.

The United States Department of Justice is using federal grand jury subpoenas to identify anonymous commenters engaged in typical internet bluster and hyperbole in connection with the Silk Road prosecution. DOJ is targeting Reason.com, a leading libertarian website whose clever writing is eclipsed only by the blowhard stupidity of its commenting peanut gallery.

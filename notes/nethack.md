The Curses interface is an alternate text-mode interface for NetHack using high-level curses routines to control the display. The curses interface has additional features compared to the traditional tty interface, such as dynamic window resizing, dynamic configurable placement of status and message windows, and mouse support.  --- [Curses interface - NetHackWiki, the NetHack Wiki](http://nethackwiki.com/wiki/Curses_interface)

<article><p>A potential direction for wiki is a sort of Hyper Card-like journal that benefits from federation, networking, and a wiki approach to life.</p>
<p>There could be a more narrow action that we now call forking.</p>
<p>A reductionist pitch would be &quot;It's like Evernote + Hyper Card + wiki. You capture your experience, but you also connect it and share it. You move from capture, to connection, to community.&quot;</p>
<p>This is how it'd work. A journal log of our thinking.</p>
<p>We'd keep your wiki as a journal, and this journal would be the core initial view. The log would also collect unexpected fork-to-local instances. If you couldn't save where you were editing, it'd save to your log wiki.</p>
<p>Instead of calling pages pages, we could call them cards, to reinforce (as with Hyper Card) that these are short, modular treatments made for quick reorganization. It also helps people understand the multi-page layout, and it eliminates the attribution problem of creating &quot;pages.&quot;</p>
<p>In the wiki log, we'd note everything you learned in a day. Stuff you heard on the way to work, such as [[Loved and Lovely]]. Things w learned in class. Instructions on how to [[Find Process Using Your Webcam]].</p>
<p>To see what that might look like we can go here:</p>
<p>From the journal, we'd also be able to push these cards to other sites of ours, as well as use more traditional fedwiki &quot;pull&quot; methods. We'd also be able to jump into those journals and build them out individually.</p>
<p>Farms would always be associated with one person, one login,and users would log in once.</p>
<p>The drag and drop abilities of fedwiki would be improved to support a broader array of &quot;clippings.&quot; One of the browser buttons associated with fedwiki would automatically forward the URL we were on to the fedwiki, and create the best guess at a Title and initial paragraph it could: YouTube URL to Video Embed, NY Times article to Title + text selected at time of button press + automatic URL link and attribution.  (Ward has already done similar).</p>
<p>For scientists, researchers, and writers the cards would support multiple plugins that would allow them to work with data and visualize it, along the lines of the CSV support now. Scientists would also start by journalling their work and then share it out as their wiki log.</p>
<p>The fedwiki could replace Evernote, Pinboard, etc. or be used as a seamless adjunct to them, since people think their real problem is capture yet they don't realize [[The Real Issue Is Connection]]. Therefore fedwiki could compete as a capture/annotation product quite easily.</p>
<p>In general, people would probably keep their running journals private, as this would make them more free to add anything they thought of during the day. However, they would have the option to push-publish anything in their journal to any public journal on their farm.</p>
<p>Unlike wiki, there would be a lot of orphan pages at any given time, and that would be OK. We don't always know where a thought or discovery will fit. But analysis functions would help people identify these pages from time to time and prompt them to connect them.</p>
<p>The pitch is simple.</p>
<p>People are capturing their reading of the web via Evernote, Pinboard, Readability, etc.</p>
<p>They then share their paraphrases or summaries across networks such as Pinboard, Pinterest, Facebook, Twitter.</p>
<p>People are even annotating: Diigo, etc.</p>
<p>Yet we're missing three vital points of true connection. Our logs, so to speak, only talk to us. How can we turn this experience into a conversation?</p>
<p>First, we must realize we aren't connecting anything. We're pushing around atomic units. Even personally, we need to connect, supplement, reflect. Without that, Evernote just becomes a new shoebox of papers.</p>
<p>Second -- We share and capture these things -- blog posts, data, pictures. But we don't give others the permission to improve them or make them better. For instance, the lesson plan somebody's wife writes for art that she shares on Pinterest may not get better as it travels the network. As far as we know. Somebody may use that lesson plan and not share back what they've done. Another example is the data we share doesn't always get connected to cool visualizations.</p>
<p>We need to let the network act on these things to really harness the power of it -- otherwise it's just a routing mechanism. Even personally, everyone has their head too much in the stream, and doesn't revisit old work. When there is a series of panels hyperlinked meaningfully, it's recursive writing, thinking, and indexing simultaneously.</p>
<p>Thirdly, and perhaps more debatable, is that serendipity is lacking in some current systems. This is harder to explain, but worth keeping in mind. We're getting less and less surprised by our networks, and that's taking the joy out of reading.</p>
<p>Our best example of how the fedwiki could advance our use of the web is in Education. Student journals become networked and meaningful beyond the courses. Entries become building blocks for future work and understanding. The [[ePortfolio]] discussion becomes simple -- students share work to a public wiki, we could call [[The Card Stack]], the institution forks what it needs to its own servers to collect evidence of learning for accredition. The rest is owned by the student or by the network of people who have forked the students work.</p>
<p>As for Business -- Let business people know that all the stuff they are shoving into Evernote is meaningless without connection. Sell them on the idea that they could quickly rearrange notes into a business plan, and use a single system to share out everything from contact cards to case studies to meeting notes.</p>
<p>&quot;Life-hackers&quot; -- these people use a lot of crappy software to build memory, mind map, increase productivity. Show them that what they really need is a sort of &quot;mind-mapping&quot; evernote and they'll come.</p>
<p>We can imagine a Pinboard-ish community around ideas. Why not? Sites would have a setting to say where they publish to -- RSS feeds, Pinboard, etc. But there also might be a fedwiki specific community that provided better integration.</p>
<p>Wikis would also have specific titles associated with them, and by default would publish new material to feeds and community sites under those titles. Tags would help alert you to new wiki content from anywhere, consistently good wiki content would prompt you to subscribe to all updates of that wiki.</p>
<p>Tags can be limiting as one word categories. Titles and/or phrases can help readers find ideas. If we thought of titles as mini-abstracts, that would help people cast a wider net than tags currently do.</p>
<p>The WordPress business model is good. Open source software plus a service business. That combination has created a situation with WP where 20% of all domains are running WordPress.</p>
<p>The Evernote Model might be interesting. Free software, we get charged based on how much we upload each month to the service. Incentives here point the right direction for both customer and business.</p>
<p>A possible product model is free browser tool, paid mobile app. As always, all is open source.</p>
<p>I think it'd be a derivation of fedwiki, not the core product.</p>
<p>Steno, as a name conveys the notebook idea, but technically stenography is &quot;narrow writing&quot; (steno=narrow) which fits the idea of a collection of small thoughts connected. It doesn't capture the networked wiki element, but that's OK -- it's easy to say &quot;Steno is your networked notebook&quot;.</p>
<p>I'm not a person of means, and I'm more a PHP/Python hacker than a real coder, so this is idle thinking. But I have this ready to share if I meet someone looking for an opportunity.</p>

> A pure numpy solution also perfroms reasonably and will be the shortest solutoin (a one-liner in this case)
>
> The pure python approach is very slow, but serves as a useful template for converting to native langauge directly or via a JIT compiler
>
> Note that the fsatest alternatives are approximately 1000 times faster than the pure python version for the test problem with n=1000 and p=3.

> Coroutines work by enabling the code consuming a generator to send a value back into the generator function after each yield expression. The generator function receives the value passed to the send function as the result of the corresponding yield expression.

> Testing data analysis pipelines is in some ways a bit trickier than general software testing, because sometimes it's exploratory in nature so there may be no 100% fixed "right" answer. However, code that given input X gave output Y must keep doing this despite changes or the output must be changed in a way that makes it better and still acceptable given some custom but well-defined criteria.

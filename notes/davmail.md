<blockquote>Ever wanted to get rid of Outlook? DavMail is a POP/IMAP/SMTP/Caldav/Carddav/LDAP exchange gateway allowing users to use any mail/calendar client (e.g. Thunderbird with Lightning or Apple iCal) with an Exchange server, even from the internet or behind a firewall through Outlook Web Access.</blockquote>

DavMail is one of the programs I'm using to escape Outlook/Exchange. It's [free here](http://davmail.sourceforge.net/).

 

You can run DavMail inside [[Docker]], which makes installation a one-liner.

JavaScript is not [[Java]].

[[Emscripten]] can compile to [[asm.js]], letting [[C/C++]] run in the browser.

// Assign y to x, default 0

var x = y || 0;

// let sets variables in block scope



for(let i=0; i < n; i++) {

  doSomething();

}



i // undefined here

The best reference for JS and related technologies by far is the [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/), I am constantly looking stuff up there. And here is a good [http://marijnhaverbeke.nl/js-cheatsheet.html cheat sheet] to reference while you're getting started.

Unfortunately, when most people think of client-JavaScript-running-on-the-server, they think of technologies like Meteor, which do ask you to write both your API server (responsible for things like authentication and authorization) and your client app in the same codebase using the same framework. Personally, I think this approach is a complexity and productivity disaster, but that deserves its own blog post --- [Youâ€™re Missing the Point of Server-Side Rendered JavaScript Apps : Tom Dale](http://tomdale.net/2015/02/youre-missing-the-point-of-server-side-rendered-javascript-apps/)

The objective of APIs.json is to help fix this problem by making it easy for people to signpost where the APIs on a given domain are and provide information on how they work. The format is simple and extensible and can be put into any web root domain for discovery. --- [APIs.json](http://apisjson.org/)

Squeak is a modern implementation of Smalltalk, the original dynamic object-oriented programming environment. It runs bit-identically on virtually any platform, and now in the web browser, too. --- [SqueakJS by Bert Freudenberg](http://bertfreudenberg.github.io/SqueakJS/)

Today, we announced the release of Scala.js v0.6.0, the Scala to JavaScript compiler, and dropped the experimental flag associated to it. Yes, you read it right: Scala.js is no longer experimental! After exactly 2 years of development, we finally feel comfortable calling it production-ready. --- [Scala.js no longer experimental | The Scala Programming Language](http://scala-lang.org/news/2015/02/05/scala-js-no-longer-experimental.html)

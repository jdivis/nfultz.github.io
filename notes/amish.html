<blockquote>
<p>I was talking to a buggy maker and he was building a new one for someone who<br />
had their buggy hit by a car (horse was killed, no people injured). He was<br />
telling me about the man in the suit who was going to settle the bill for the<br />
loss of the buggy. The buggy maker couldn’t understand why the man wouldn’t<br />
reimburse the full cost of a new buggy and he kept asking the buggy maker how<br />
old the buggy was that got destroyed. The Amish man just felt the only right<br />
thing to do was replace the buggy, and not just a percentage of it. I realized<br />
it was an insurance agent and he was talking about depreciation. I guess the<br />
agent and the buggy maker were getting pretty exasperated with each other, but<br />
finally the agent asked how long one could expect a buggy to last, and the<br />
buggy maker told him thirty or forty years. At that the agent gave up and paid<br />
the full claim (which was only $1,500 for a brand new buggy!). But it was<br />
sobering to hear, on the one hand the straightforward, simple, innocent<br />
sensibilities of the Amish buggy maker versus the calculating, reductive logic<br />
of the insurance agent. As an Amish furniture maker once told me, I don’t want<br />
any part of some money-making scheme. Words to live by.<br />

Some commands never change: [[make]], [[grep]], [[awk]], [[diff]] and so on.

tab, a modern text processing language that's similar to awk in spirit. (But not similar in design philosophy, implementation or syntax.)



Highlights:

<ul>

    <li>Designed for concise one-liner aggregation and manupulation of tabular text data.

    <li>Makes no compromises on performance; aims to be no slower than traditional old-school UNIX shell utilities whenever possible.

    <li>Feature-rich enough to support even very complex queries. (Also includes a good set of mathematical operations.)

    <li>Statically typed, type-inferred, declarative.

    <li>Portable: requires only a standards-compliant C  11 compiler and nothing else. </ul> --- [tkatchev / tab â€” Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/tkatchev/tab)

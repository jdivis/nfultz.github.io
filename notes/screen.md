Screen is a terminal emulator, which is to say, a terminal inside a terminal.

You can start <code>screen</code> by running it in a terminal. You might see a welcome prompt; and then you'll be returned to the shell prompt.

It may look as though nothing has happened, but you are now working in a shell inside screen.

Screen is customized by editing it's [[dotfile]], <code>.screenrc</code>.

I originally learned screen from the excellent [kuro5hin tutorial](http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2004/3/9/16838/14935).

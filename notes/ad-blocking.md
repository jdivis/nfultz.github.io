Some high-quality sites, such as Om Malik’s GigaOM, have folded, while others have been rolled up into larger entities. The Huffington Post was acquired by AoL; Re/Code (née All Things D) was absorbed by Vox Media, which is now partly owned (a $200M investment) by NBC Universal, itself a part of the Comcast empire. NBC/Comcast just made $200M investment in BuzzFeed.



Other media organizations have found individuals of substantial means to buy a large stake in the company, or acquire it outright. Jeff Bezos now owns the Washington Post, and also made a significant investment in Business Insider (whose Wikipedia page makes no mention of Bezos). The  New York Times’ largest shareholder is Mexican magnate Carlos Slim, the second richest person in the world.

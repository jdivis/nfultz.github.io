bitlbee is an IRC-to-chat bridge; it lets you use AIM, gTalk, etc through a standard IRC client.

To get started, send bitlbee

help quickstart

and follow the directions.

For gTalk, you need to add a jabber account. If the account is a hosted Google  and then reset the server.

[Bug 1179](http://bugs.bitlbee.org/bitlbee/ticket/1179) explains a workaround if the gTalk connection is flaky.

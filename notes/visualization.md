Producing clean graphs can be a challenging task. First you have to consider what is the best way in which to convey the information: a line graph, a histogram, a multi-panel plot; such conceptual dilemmaâ€™s are not dealt with in this compendium, and instead we recommend the reader to the chapters on creating graphs in the excellent book by Briscoe (1996). Second, you have to use computer software to translate the conceptual graph to a publication-ready figure. This is the phase where this compendium may be useful, because it brings together R code for producing a set of clean, publication-ready figures. Hopefully this will make it easy to copy-paste and adjust the code to suit your own needs. --- [A Compendium of Clean Graphs in R](http://shinyapps.org/apps/RGraphCompendium/index.php#introduction)

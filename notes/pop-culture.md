A Naked Singularity tells the story of Casi, a child of Colombian immigrants who lives in Brooklyn and works in Manhattan as a public defender--one who, tellingly has never lost a trial. Never. In the book, we watch what happens when his sense of justice and even his sense of self begin to crack--and how his world then slowly devolves. --- [A Naked Singularity: A Novel, De La Pava](http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/N/bo13106363.html)

This is especially true given the demise of the so-called Privilege Sign, which was a retail placard given free to store owners by a supplier of a product sold within.



The most common privilege signs had Coke or Pepsi logos on them. Those signs have been vanishing since the 1960s, according to the Ephemeral New York website, which tracks remaining examples of the retail artifact. Without such signage, Swormstedt says, a flashy placard is the most valuable tool a shopkeeper can utilize. --- [Thing Piece: The Ugliest Sign in America — Matter — Medium](https://medium.com/matter/thing-piece-the-ugliest-sign-in-america-5f53652ba7b)

Perception: Affirmative action is the gravy train that leads to a plethora of job offers with the snap of a finger.



Reality: Checking the African American box on a job application is a rookie mistake. While I doubt that many hiring managers intentionally penalize minorities, unconscious biases do exist (we all have them).

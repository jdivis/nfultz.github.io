<article><h2>Irony</h2>
<p>King is not <em>subtle</em> about irony in his new book:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The one on the left was saying, “Live the life you love!” The other was saying,
“Love the life you live!” Luke stared at this, bemused.</p>
<p>“What do you call a poster like that in a place like this, smart kid?” Nicky
asked.</p>
<p>“Irony, sarcasm, or bullshit?”</p>
<p>“All three,” Luke said, and sat down beside him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“And try not to break your neck,” George said. “But if you do, I’ll sing ‘You
Are So Beautiful’ at your funeral.”</p>
<p>Avery looked at George fixedly for a moment or two, then said, “But you hate
that song.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” George said. “Yes, I do.  Saying what I did is called satire. Or maybe
irony. I always get those two things mixed up. Go on, now. Put an egg in your
shoe and beat it.”</p>
<p>There were always more children here, but the longer they stayed in Back Half,
the less they ate. Mrs. Sigsby supposed an English major might call that irony.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“They were already doing it, but then they got out. Mostly because of Avery,
and Avery was there because he helped me get out. I guess you’d call that
irony. But I’m pretty sure they’re trapped again. I’m afraid Stackhouse will
kill them if I can’t make a deal.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What, exactly, was that understanding? Why, that aside from having a yard of
guts, the kid also happened to be a genuine bottled-in-bond genius. These
Institute thugs had taken him to obtain a talent that was (at least before its
enhancement) little more than a parlor trick. They considered his brilliance a
mere adjunct to what they were really after, making them like poachers willing
to slaughter a twelve-thousand-pound elephant to get ninety pounds of ivory.
Tim doubted if Evans could appreciate the irony,</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Bernoulli</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“Once I got access to a real computer,” Luke resumed, “I did a Bernoulli
distribution. Do you know what that is, Mr. Smith?”</p>
<p>The blond man shook his head.</p>
<p>“He does, though,” Kalisha said. Her eyes were merry.</p>
<p>“Right,” Nicky agreed. “And doesn’t like it. The Whatzis distribution is not his friend.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oh ho!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The Bernoulli is an accurate way of expressing probability,”</p>
<p>“It’s based on the idea that there are two possible outcomes to certain
empiric events, like coin flips or the winners of football games. The outcomes
can be expressed as p for positive result and n for negative result. I won’t
bore you with the details, but you end up with a boolean-valued outcome that
clearly expresses the difference between random and non-random events.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What?</p>
<p>He continues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Coin flips are random. Football scores appear random if you take a small sample, but
if you take a bigger one, it becomes clear that they’re not, because other
factors come into play. Then it becomes a probability situation, and if the
probability of A is greater than the probability of B, then in most cases, A
will happen. You know that if you’ve ever bet on a sporting event, right?”</p>
<p>Any math wonk with a computer can run a Bernoulli distribution.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Research Assistants</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Russ’s fingerprints are all over the book you have just read, from the BDNF
tests for newborns (yes, it’s a real thing, only a bit fictionalized), to how
poison gas could be created from common household products (don’t try this at
home, kids). He vetted every line and fact, helping me toward what has always
been my goal: making the impossible plausible. He was a big, blond,
broad-shouldered man who loved a joke and a beer and shooting off bottle
rockets on the Fourth of July. He raised two wonderful daughters and saw his
wife through her final lingering illness. We worked together, but he was also
my friend. We were simpatico. Never had a single argument.</p>
<p>Russ died of kidney failure in the fall of 2018, and I miss him like hell. Sure, when I need
information (lately it’s been elevators and first-generation iPhones), but a
lot more when I forget he’s gone and think, “Hey, I should give Russ a call or
drop him an email, ask what’s going on.” This book is dedicated to my
grandsons, because it’s mostly about kids, but it’s Russ I’m thinking about as
I put it to bed. It’s very hard to let old friends go.</p>
<p>I miss you, buddy.</p>

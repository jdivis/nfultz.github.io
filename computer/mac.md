<!-- njnmdoc:  title="Mac notes"  -->

I never had a mac until I got to [[Los Angeles]], and then they were dumped on me.

F.lux is the Mac version of redshift.

Apparently, Apple decided to delete <code>/etc/motd</code> in Leopard.

<code>$PATH</code> is set indirectly in <code>/etc/profile</code> as usual, using the <code>path_helper</code> command. It will read the contents of <code>/etc/paths.d</code> and place them on the path.

## Irony

King is not _subtle_ about irony in his new book:

> The one on the left was saying, “Live the life you love!” The other was saying,
> “Love the life you live!” Luke stared at this, bemused.
>
> “What do you call a poster like that in a place like this, smart kid?” Nicky
> asked.
>
> “Irony, sarcasm, or bullshit?”
>
> “All three,” Luke said, and sat down beside him.

And:

> “And try not to break your neck,” George said. “But if you do, I’ll sing ‘You
> Are So Beautiful’ at your funeral.”
>
> Avery looked at George fixedly for a moment or two, then said, “But you hate
> that song.”
>
> “Yes,” George said. “Yes, I do.  Saying what I did is called satire. Or maybe
> irony. I always get those two things mixed up. Go on, now. Put an egg in your
> shoe and beat it.”


> There were always more children here, but the longer they stayed in Back Half,
> the less they ate. Mrs. Sigsby supposed an English major might call that irony.


And:

> “They were already doing it, but then they got out. Mostly because of Avery,
> and Avery was there because he helped me get out. I guess you’d call that
> irony. But I’m pretty sure they’re trapped again. I’m afraid Stackhouse will
> kill them if I can’t make a deal.”

And:

> What, exactly, was that understanding? Why, that aside from having a yard of
> guts, the kid also happened to be a genuine bottled-in-bond genius. These
> Institute thugs had taken him to obtain a talent that was (at least before its
> enhancement) little more than a parlor trick. They considered his brilliance a
> mere adjunct to what they were really after, making them like poachers willing
> to slaughter a twelve-thousand-pound elephant to get ninety pounds of ivory.
> Tim doubted if Evans could appreciate the irony,

## Bernoulli

> “Once I got access to a real computer,” Luke resumed, “I did a Bernoulli
> distribution. Do you know what that is, Mr. Smith?”
>
> The blond man shook his head.
>
> “He does, though,” Kalisha said. Her eyes were merry.
>
> “Right,” Nicky agreed. “And doesn’t like it. The Whatzis distribution is not his friend.”


Oh ho!

> “The Bernoulli is an accurate way of expressing probability,”
>
>  “It’s based on the idea that there are two possible outcomes to certain
> empiric events, like coin flips or the winners of football games. The outcomes
> can be expressed as p for positive result and n for negative result. I won’t
> bore you with the details, but you end up with a boolean-valued outcome that
> clearly expresses the difference between random and non-random events.”

What?

He continues:

>  “Coin flips are random. Football scores appear random if you take a small sample, but
> if you take a bigger one, it becomes clear that they’re not, because other
> factors come into play. Then it becomes a probability situation, and if the
> probability of A is greater than the probability of B, then in most cases, A
> will happen. You know that if you’ve ever bet on a sporting event, right?”


> Any math wonk with a computer can run a Bernoulli distribution.


## Research Assistants

> Russ’s fingerprints are all over the book you have just read, from the BDNF
> tests for newborns (yes, it’s a real thing, only a bit fictionalized), to how
> poison gas could be created from common household products (don’t try this at
> home, kids). He vetted every line and fact, helping me toward what has always
> been my goal: making the impossible plausible. He was a big, blond,
> broad-shouldered man who loved a joke and a beer and shooting off bottle
> rockets on the Fourth of July. He raised two wonderful daughters and saw his
> wife through her final lingering illness. We worked together, but he was also
> my friend. We were simpatico. Never had a single argument.
>
> Russ died of kidney failure in the fall of 2018, and I miss him like hell. Sure, when I need
> information (lately it’s been elevators and first-generation iPhones), but a
> lot more when I forget he’s gone and think, “Hey, I should give Russ a call or
> drop him an email, ask what’s going on.” This book is dedicated to my
> grandsons, because it’s mostly about kids, but it’s Russ I’m thinking about as
> I put it to bed. It’s very hard to let old friends go.
>
>  I miss you, buddy.
